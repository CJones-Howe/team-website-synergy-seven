      <h2><u>How Does CTE Affect the Brain Over Time?</u></h2>
      <p class="cte-text">
        Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive, degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma. It primarily affects athletes, military personnel, and others who experience frequent brain injuries. Over time, tau protein builds up in the brain, leading to memory loss, confusion, and emotional instability.

  <h2><u>Famous Cases of CTE</u></h2>

  <div class="case">
    <h3><strong>Aaron Hernandez</strong></h3>
    <img src="a.png" alt="Aaron Hernandez" class="case-image" width="200" />
    <p>Former NFL player convicted of murder and later died by suicide. Posthumous studies revealed he had one of the most severe cases of CTE ever seen in someone his age. In 2015 former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison eventually committing suicide 2 years into his sentence. Why did such a successful NFL player with millions of dollars commit such a heinous crime without being under the influence of drugs and or alcohol at the time of the murder resulting in his own life being taken? Science points to arguably the most famous case of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy or CTE, a neurodegenerative brain disease associated with violence, depression, and dementia like symptoms

  <div class="case">
    <h3><strong>Brett Favre</strong></h3>
    <img src="b.png" alt="Brett Favre" class="case-image" width="200" />
    <p>Although not officially diagnosed, Brett Favre has publicly expressed concern over memory loss and the potential long-term effects of concussions sustained during his career.</p>

  <div class="case">
    <h3><strong>Sugar Ray Robinson</strong></h3>

    <p>Legendary boxer whose later life was marked by signs of neurological decline, possibly linked to head trauma sustained in the ring.</p>

  <!-- Symptoms and Research Section -->
  <section class="cte-info" id="symptoms">
  <h2 style="color: #e91e63;"> <u>Symptoms of CTE</u></h2>
  <p>CTE symptoms don’t usually appear immediately — they often emerge **years or decades after** repeated head trauma. They can be subtle at first but grow more severe over time.</p>

  <div class="symptom-block">
    <h3 style="color: #e91e63;"> Early Symptoms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Memory problems:</strong> Difficulty recalling recent events, names, or locations.</li>
      <li><strong>Impulsivity:</strong> Risky decisions, poor judgment, or inappropriate behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Mood swings:</strong> Sudden irritability, frustration, or emotional instability.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="symptom-block">
    <h3 style="color: #e91e63;"> Mid-Stage Symptoms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Depression and Anxiety:</strong> Ongoing sadness, hopelessness, or worry unrelated to events.</li>
      <li><strong>Paranoia:</strong> Suspicion or distrust of others, sometimes with no clear reason.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Withdrawal:</strong> Avoiding friends, family, and social situations.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="symptom-block">
    <h3 style="color: #e91e63;"> Late-Stage Symptoms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dementia:</strong> Severe confusion, disorientation, and loss of function.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggressive behavior:</strong> Outbursts, violence, or emotional eruptions.</li>
      <li><strong>Suicidal thoughts or actions:</strong> In later stages, CTE is linked with self-harm in some individuals.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <section class="cte-research" id="research">
    <h2> <u>Ongoing Research on CTE</u></h2>
    <div class="research-block">
      <h3>1. Brain Imaging (PET Scans)</h3>
      <p>Scientists are working on PET scans that highlight tau protein buildup in the brain using radioactive tracers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="research-block">
      <h3>2. Blood & Spinal Fluid Tests</h3>
      <p>Clinical trials are testing biomarkers such as neurofilament light (NfL) for early, non-invasive diagnosis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="research-block">
      <h3>3. Genetic Factors</h3>
      <p>Certain genes may increase susceptibility to CTE. Studies are identifying genetic risk markers linked to repetitive head trauma.</p>

<section class="web-security" id="security">
  <h2 style="color: #e91e63;"><u>Web Security & CTE Awareness Sites</u></h2>
  <p>Modern websites use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to encrypt data between the user’s browser and the web server. This protects personal data and prevents hackers from intercepting it. SSL certificates confirm a site's identity and enable this encryption. Understanding and applying web security principles is essential for building trustworthy, safe, and professional online resources.</p>
